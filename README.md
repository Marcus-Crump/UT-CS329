# UT-CS329

This is the repository where I will be storing my solutions to the assignments outlined in [this syllabus](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs429/syllabus429.html) from 2020.

## The Plan
In pursuit of a comprehensive understanding of computer science, I have chosen to independently study the material from the University of Texas at Austin's CS 429: Computer Organization and Architecture course this summer. This self-directed approach allows me to delve deeply into each aspect of the curriculum without the constraints of deadlines, fostering a more thorough and reflective learning experience.  

In addition to utilizing the textbooks and resources outlined in the syllabus, I am supplementing my study of computer architecture by engaging with *Turing Complete*, an educational puzzle game designed to teach digital logic and computer architecture concepts through a series of challenges and problems. In addition to the homework assignments, this interactive platform allows me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, hands-on environment, reinforcing my understanding through problem-solving and experimentation. Moreover, the game's engaging format serves as a motivating tool, encouraging continued learning even when faced with complex topics.  

Regarding the assignments, I plan to follow the instructions and adhere to the style guidelines as outlined in the course materials to align with the standards of the UT CS 429 course. As I am not formally enrolled in the course and am utilizing materials from a previous offering, I will not receive feedback on the accuracy of my work. I am undertaking this self-study for personal enrichment and skill development.  

I understand the importance of upholding academic integrity and the University's policies on the use of course materials. If my use of these materials in this context raises any concerns or violates any policies, please feel free to contact me at m.crump@utexas.edu, and I will take appropriate action to address the issue.

## The Journey
To complement my self-study of computer architecture, I plan to document my learning journey and critically evaluate the educational content presented in Turing Complete. This documentation will be shared through a blog, serving both as a reflective learning tool and a dynamic portfolio to showcase my progress and insights. While I am at the initial stages of this endeavor and have not yet published content, I will update both this Markdown file and the blog as I advance in my studies.
